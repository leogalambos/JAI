## Enterprise architecture models (business, data, application, technology)

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Accept the architecture baseline and prioritise documented architecture gaps.
- **Mandatory examples:** Provide stable identified entities and typed relationships with ownership and provenance. Define entity/relation types, constraints, model boundary and source baseline. Evidence referential integrity, constraint checks, cross-view consistency and known gaps.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include deeper calculations or technical detail only when linked to a reader need.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `enterprise-architect:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business strategy and capability model
- Current estate inventory
- Investment portfolio
- Technology lifecycle data

**Specification:** `kind/architecture-definition`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Accept the architecture baseline and prioritise documented architecture gaps.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/model`](spec-type-model.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

**`adr.architecture_choice`** — `object`

- Record the selected design, decision owner and dated rationale.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`adr.consequences`** — `object`

- Describe technical debt, reversibility, operational impacts and residual risks.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`adr.supersession`** — `object`

- Record predecessor links or explicitly state that no decision is superseded.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Conditionally required information

**`adr.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify personal-data flows, lawful handling constraints, minimisation and review evidence.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`adr.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Trace each applicable regulatory obligation to scope, evidence and competent interpretation; exceptions cannot waive law.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Optional information (MAY)

**`adr.technical_annex`** — `object`

- Include deeper calculations or technical detail only when linked to a reader need.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`adr.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Never state a material conclusion as established without evidence or explicit uncertainty.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`adr.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove detail that does not support the stated purpose or a referenced annex.

**`adr.duplicate_claim`** — `object`

- Reference an existing claim instead of repeating it without new analytical value.
