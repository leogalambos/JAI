## Enterprise architecture models (business, data, application, technology)

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Accept the architecture baseline and prioritise documented architecture gaps.
- **Mandatory examples:** Provide stable identified entities and typed relationships with ownership and provenance. Define entity/relation types, constraints, model boundary and source baseline. Evidence referential integrity, constraint checks, cross-view consistency and known gaps.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include deeper calculations or technical detail only when linked to a reader need.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `enterprise-architect:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business strategy and capability model
- Current estate inventory
- Investment portfolio
- Technology lifecycle data

**Specification:** `kind/architecture-definition`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Accept the architecture baseline and prioritise documented architecture gaps.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/model`](spec-type-model.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `architecture-description`.

Concern-driven architecture description with linked views; notation chosen for audience and qualified project profile.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned architecture baseline
- cross-view review results

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## architecture decision records

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Accept or reject an architectural design choice and its documented consequences.
- **Mandatory examples:** Describe rejected options, reversibility, debt and operational consequences. Record decision status, owner, date and architecture concern. Compare feasible alternatives against explicit drivers and constraints.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include deeper calculations or technical detail only when linked to a reader need.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `enterprise-architect:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business strategy and capability model
- Current estate inventory
- Investment portfolio
- Technology lifecycle data

**Specification:** `kind/adr`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Accept or reject an architectural design choice and its documented consequences.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/architecture-decision`](spec-type-architecture-decision.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `architecture-decision-record`.

Versioned ADR; an EA tool representation is optional.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- option evaluation
- actual decision status and supersession links

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
