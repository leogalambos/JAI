## Shared pipeline templates and reusable workflows

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Shared pipeline templates and reusable workflows.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define ordered automated stages, verification checkpoints, error handling, stop conditions and rollback or forward recovery paths. Identify exact deployment targets, versioned build inputs, configuration contracts and authorised execution boundaries without secrets. Link reproducible automation checks and observed outcomes to controlled environments; do not claim production execution or authorisation without evidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ci-cd-platform-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Team build requirements
- Supply chain and scanning requirements
- Runner infrastructure capability
- Delivery metrics

**Specification:** `kind/role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Shared pipeline templates and reusable workflows.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/deployment-automation`](spec-family-deployment-automation.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:1.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: Shared pipeline templates and reusable workflows.

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:1.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:1.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Pipelines authenticate to cloud providers with short-lived federated identity, never long-lived static credentials held in the CI system
- G9: Every released artefact carries signed provenance naming the source commit, the builder and the inputs — an artefact that cannot be traced to a commit cannot be released
- G10: Pipeline definitions are code and are reviewed like code
- G11: a workflow editable in a web console without review is an unreviewed production change path
- G12: Self-hosted runners that execute untrusted pull-request code are ephemeral and isolated, because a shared runner is a lateral movement path into the build system

## supply chain provenance and attestation configuration

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: supply chain provenance and attestation configuration.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify managed assets, tool/schema versions and authorised configuration scope. Provide typed desired settings, permitted ranges and secret-manager references. Evidence reproducibility, drift checks, deployment validation and rollback to a known baseline.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ci-cd-platform-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Team build requirements
- Supply chain and scanning requirements
- Runner infrastructure capability
- Delivery metrics

**Specification:** `kind/role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: supply chain provenance and attestation configuration.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: supply chain provenance and attestation configuration.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (DevOps Engineer; Build Engineer; Release Engineer; Software Engineer), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'supply chain provenance and attestation configuration', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Defines build/source identities, provenance fields, signing trust, verification policy and reproducible positive/negative checks. Required delivery form: Versioned provenance and attestation configuration.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/ci-cd-platform-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Pipelines authenticate to cloud providers with short-lived federated identity, never long-lived static credentials held in the CI system
- G9: Every released artefact carries signed provenance naming the source commit, the builder and the inputs — an artefact that cannot be traced to a commit cannot be released
- G10: Pipeline definitions are code and are reviewed like code
- G11: a workflow editable in a web console without review is an unreviewed production change path
- G12: Self-hosted runners that execute untrusted pull-request code are ephemeral and isolated, because a shared runner is a lateral movement path into the build system
