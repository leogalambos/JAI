## User interface implementation

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: User interface implementation.
- **Mandatory examples:** Trace implemented behaviour and changed interfaces to requirements, design constraints and the exact reviewed source revision. Define deployment compatibility, telemetry, failure detection and rollback or forward recovery constraints. Identify reproducible automated checks, observed results, untested risks and independent review findings without inventing execution.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `frontend-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Design specification with all states
- API contracts
- Accessibility requirements
- Browser and device support matrix

**Specification:** `kind/role/frontend-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: User interface implementation.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/software-change`](spec-family-software-change.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-source-change`.

Actual version-controlled implementation or analysis code, separate from its explanatory report.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- exact source and dependency revision
- observed checks and independent review

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## component tests and visual regression coverage

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: component tests and visual regression coverage.
- **Mandatory examples:** Give reproducible invocation, assertions, expected outcomes and failure diagnostics; distinguish test definitions from evidence of executed runs. Define isolation, dependency handling, flakiness investigation, coverage limitations and maintenance ownership. Trace executable cases and reusable test abstractions to requirements, risk coverage, deterministic data and environment assumptions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

- **Mandatory examples:** Link test cases and requirements to actual outcomes, timestamps and execution evidence. Explain defects, untested scope, achieved exit criteria and residual release risk. Identify build, requirements, environment, reporting period and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `frontend-engineer:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Design specification with all states
- API contracts
- Accessibility requirements
- Browser and device support matrix

**Specification:** `kind/role/frontend-engineer:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

## performance budget results

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: performance budget results.
- **Mandatory examples:** Link test cases and requirements to actual outcomes, timestamps and execution evidence. Explain defects, untested scope, achieved exit criteria and residual release risk. Identify build, requirements, environment, reporting period and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `frontend-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Design specification with all states
- API contracts
- Accessibility requirements
- Browser and device support matrix

**Specification:** `kind/role/frontend-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: performance budget results.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-report`](spec-type-test-report.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `test-results`.

Observed test results against a named baseline with passed, failed, blocked and unexecuted cases.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- expected/actual observations and execution references
- coverage denominators and residual defects

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: performance budget results.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Test Automation Engineer; Accessibility Tester), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'performance budget results', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Identify exact tested build, requirements baseline, environment/data versions, test period and deviations from the plan. State passed, failed, blocked and unexecuted cases with evidence references; give denominators and traceability so counts cannot disguise missing coverage. Summarise defects by business impact, unmet exit criteria, untested risks and limitations; separate a release recommendation from release authorisation. Existing source requirement: Compares observed loading, interaction and resource metrics with stated targets, device/network conditions and unresolved regressions. Required delivery form: Observed test results against a named baseline with passed, failed, blocked and unexecuted cases.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/frontend-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Keyboard operability, focus management and screen-reader labelling are verified before merge, not deferred to an accessibility sweep
