## Device images and configuration baselines

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Device images and configuration baselines.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify managed assets, tool/schema versions and authorised configuration scope. Provide typed desired settings, permitted ranges and secret-manager references. Evidence reproducibility, drift checks, deployment validation and rollback to a known baseline.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `end-user-computing-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Security baseline requirements
- User and role requirements
- Application catalogue
- Device and OS lifecycle data

**Specification:** `kind/role/end-user-computing-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Device images and configuration baselines.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.

## compliance and patch reporting

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: compliance and patch reporting.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify the specific choice, accountable authority and decision deadline. Explain cost, benefit, dependencies, uncertainty and residual risks of the recommendation. Compare viable options including the do-nothing baseline against common criteria.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `end-user-computing-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Security baseline requirements
- User and role requirements
- Application catalogue
- Device and OS lifecycle data

**Specification:** `kind/role/end-user-computing-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: compliance and patch reporting.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/decision-paper`](spec-type-decision-paper.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government); [source](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/end-user-computing-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government); [source](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/end-user-computing-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'compliance and patch reporting', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Conclusions are traceable to dated evidence; opinion is visibly separated from fact. Required delivery form: Structured document with executive summary and evidence annex.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government); [source](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/end-user-computing-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Patch and configuration compliance is measured continuously with an enforced remediation deadline
- G9: devices out of compliance beyond the window lose access rather than being exempted informally
