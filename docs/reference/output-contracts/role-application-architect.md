## Application structure and module boundaries

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Application structure and module boundaries.
- **Mandatory examples:** Describe bounded component responsibilities and deployment topology. Map measurable quality requirements to design verification and acceptance. Define versioned interface inputs, outputs, trust boundaries and failure handling.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `application-architect:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Feature roadmap
- Current code and dependency analysis
- Defect and change hotspots
- Runtime behaviour

**Specification:** `kind/role/application-architect:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Application structure and module boundaries.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/solution-design`](spec-type-solution-design.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `solution-design`.

Versioned solution design with component responsibilities, interfaces and measurable quality responses.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- requirements-to-design traceability
- independent design review

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## dependency and layering rules

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: dependency and layering rules.

## application architecture decision records

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: application architecture decision records.
- **Mandatory examples:** Describe rejected options, reversibility, debt and operational consequences. Record decision status, owner, date and architecture concern. Compare feasible alternatives against explicit drivers and constraints.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `application-architect:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Feature roadmap
- Current code and dependency analysis
- Defect and change hotspots
- Runtime behaviour

**Specification:** `kind/role/application-architect:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: application architecture decision records.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/architecture-decision`](spec-type-architecture-decision.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `architecture-decision-record`.

Versioned decision record with context, alternatives, consequences, status and supersession.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- comparable option evaluation
- actual decision status and owner

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

**`role/application-architect:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.

- G2: Every significant decision has an ADR with an explicit consequences section, including the negative ones.
- G3: The design names its failure modes and its blast radius, not just its happy path.
- G4: Deviations accepted at build time are recorded as debt with an owner and a repayment trigger.
