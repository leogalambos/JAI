## Security architecture and control set

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Security architecture and control set.
- **Mandatory examples:** Provide stable identified entities and typed relationships with ownership and provenance. Define entity/relation types, constraints, model boundary and source baseline. Evidence referential integrity, constraint checks, cross-view consistency and known gaps.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `security-architect:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business risk appetite
- Solution designs
- Threat intelligence
- Regulatory control requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/security-architect:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Security architecture and control set.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/model`](spec-type-model.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `typed-semantic-model`.

Versioned typed model with stable entities, relations, constraints, provenance and selected views.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- metamodel/reference/cross-view checks
- source baseline and unresolved semantic gaps

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## security requirements for projects

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: security requirements for projects.
- **Mandatory examples:** Trace stakeholder needs, authoritative sources, scope and assumptions to requirement identifiers. Identify conflicting requirements, dependencies, traceability gaps and change approval responsibility. State uniquely identified testable requirements, priority, rationale, interfaces and measurable acceptance conditions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `security-architect:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business risk appetite
- Solution designs
- Threat intelligence
- Regulatory control requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/security-architect:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: security requirements for projects.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/requirements-specification`](spec-family-requirements-specification.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `requirements-specification`.

Uniquely identified verifiable requirements with rationale, priority, sources and acceptance conditions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- forward/backward traceability
- conflict, interface and change-impact checks

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

**`role/security-architect:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: Every quality attribute has a target number and a way of measuring it before design starts.
- G2: Every significant decision has an ADR with an explicit consequences section, including the negative ones.
- G3: The design names its failure modes and its blast radius, not just its happy path.
- G4: Deviations accepted at build time are recorded as debt with an owner and a repayment trigger.
- G5: Every control in the design traces to a specific threat and a business risk
- G6: controls with no traced threat are removed as cost without benefit
