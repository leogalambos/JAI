## Database configuration baselines

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Database configuration baselines.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify managed assets, tool/schema versions and authorised configuration scope. Provide typed desired settings, permitted ranges and secret-manager references. Evidence reproducibility, drift checks, deployment validation and rollback to a known baseline.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `database-administrator:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Workload and query patterns
- Recovery objectives
- Security and access requirements
- Growth forecast

**Specification:** `kind/role/database-administrator:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Database configuration baselines.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/database-administrator:1.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: Database configuration baselines.

- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `database-administrator:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Workload and query patterns
- Recovery objectives
- Security and access requirements
- Growth forecast

**Specification:** `kind/role/database-administrator:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: capacity and growth forecast.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/database-administrator:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: capacity and growth forecast.

**`role/database-administrator:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Backend Engineer; Site Reliability Engineer), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.

**`role/database-administrator:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.

**`role/database-administrator:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.

**`role/database-administrator:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'capacity and growth forecast', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Reviewed by a competent second party; complete, dated and attributable. Required delivery form: Versioned artefact in the agreed system of record.

**`role/database-administrator:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: A recurring incident gets a root-cause analysis that compares against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors — duration, ordering, schedules, expiry — before a permanent fix is chosen (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G2: No change reaches production outside the agreed change path, including 'emergency' changes, which are logged retrospectively within the agreed window.
- G3: Evidence needed for root-cause analysis is preserved before destructive recovery actions.
- G4: Communication cadence is met for every major incident, with a named communications owner.
- G5: Every recurring incident has an open problem record; recurrence without a problem record is a process failure.
- G6: Restores are tested end to end on the agreed cycle and the evidence retained
- G7: an untested backup is reported as no backup

**`role/database-administrator:4.contract_input_1`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Workload and query patterns" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/database-administrator:4.contract_input_2`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Recovery objectives" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/database-administrator:4.contract_input_3`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Security and access requirements" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/database-administrator:4.contract_input_4`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Growth forecast" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

### Conditionally required information

**`role/database-administrator:4.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify in-scope personal-data flows, minimisation, authorised handling and competent review evidence.

**`role/database-administrator:4.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.

### Optional information (MAY)

**`role/database-administrator:4.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`role/database-administrator:4.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`role/database-administrator:4.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.
