## Automated test suites

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Automated test suites.
- **Mandatory examples:** Give reproducible invocation, assertions, expected outcomes and failure diagnostics; distinguish test definitions from evidence of executed runs. Define isolation, dependency handling, flakiness investigation, coverage limitations and maintenance ownership. Trace executable cases and reusable test abstractions to requirements, risk coverage, deterministic data and environment assumptions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `test-automation-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Acceptance criteria
- Application interfaces
- Pipeline integration points
- Test data strategy

**Specification:** `kind/role/test-automation-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Automated test suites.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/automated-tests`](spec-family-automated-tests.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

Basis: `informed-by`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.

## coverage-against-risk analysis

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: coverage-against-risk analysis.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define test levels, techniques, environments, representative data and responsibilities. Define traceable entry/exit criteria, coverage measurement and defect disposition rules. Define risk-based test objectives, quality targets, scope and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `test-automation-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Acceptance criteria
- Application interfaces
- Pipeline integration points
- Test data strategy

**Specification:** `kind/role/test-automation-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: coverage-against-risk analysis.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-strategy`](spec-type-test-strategy.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: coverage-against-risk analysis.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Software Engineer; Build Engineer), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'coverage-against-risk analysis', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Reviewed by a competent second party; complete, dated and attributable. Required delivery form: Versioned artefact in the agreed system of record.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/test-automation-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: Exit criteria are agreed before execution starts and are not renegotiated during the crunch without a recorded decision.
- G2: Residual risk is stated in business terms and accepted by a named person before release.
- G3: No production personal data is used in test environments without an approved lawful basis and masking.
- G4: An intermittent test failure is investigated as a timing, ordering or shared-state defect, never retried or quarantined away without a ticket and an analysis (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G5: Automated tests are deterministic, test one behaviour each, mock only collaborators and run integration tests against real dependencies (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G6: The primary deliverable ("Automated test suites") distinguishes what was tested, what was not tested and what cannot be tested.
- G7: Flaky tests are quarantined and fixed or deleted within the agreed window
- G8: a suite people ignore is worse than no suite
