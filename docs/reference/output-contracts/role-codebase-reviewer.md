## Codebase review report with prioritised findings

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Codebase review report with prioritised findings.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define tested obligations, assurance period, sample and exclusions. Link procedures and observed results to immutable evidence and located deviations. Limit the independent conclusion to tested scope, evidence strength and unresolved findings.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `codebase-reviewer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Repository access at a named commit
- Review criteria and target quality attributes
- Change and defect history
- Runtime and incident evidence

**Specification:** `kind/role/codebase-reviewer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Codebase review report with prioritised findings.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/assurance-report`](spec-type-assurance-report.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `assurance-assessment`.

Evidence-linked assessment with criteria, population/sample, observed findings and bounded conclusion.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- criterion-to-test-to-observation traceability
- independent reviewer and limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

For each criterion, identify procedure, sample, observed result, supporting material and located deviations; distinguish absent evidence from demonstrated failure. Bound the conclusion by coverage and limitations; list findings, severity rationale, management response, remediation owner and verification needed for closure.

## architecture conformance and coupling analysis

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: architecture conformance and coupling analysis.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

## test coverage and risk gap assessment

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: test coverage and risk gap assessment.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define tested obligations, assurance period, sample and exclusions. Link procedures and observed results to immutable evidence and located deviations. Limit the independent conclusion to tested scope, evidence strength and unresolved findings.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `codebase-reviewer:3`.

**Required inputs:**

**Specification:** `kind/role/codebase-reviewer:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: test coverage and risk gap assessment.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

## dependency and supply chain exposure register

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: dependency and supply chain exposure register.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `codebase-reviewer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Repository access at a named commit
- Review criteria and target quality attributes
- Change and defect history
- Runtime and incident evidence

**Specification:** `kind/role/codebase-reviewer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: dependency and supply chain exposure register.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- actual source-attributed records
- uniqueness, completeness and relationship reconciliation

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
