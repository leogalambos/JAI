## Interface content and microcopy

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Interface content and microcopy.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `content-designer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- User research and terminology findings
- Legal and regulatory wording constraints
- Design flows and states
- Support contact themes

**Specification:** `kind/role/content-designer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Interface content and microcopy.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `professional-document`.

Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- attributable subject-specific findings and limitations
- reviewable sources and verifiable follow-up actions

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## error and system message library

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: error and system message library.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify actual governed entities with owners, source, status and lifecycle dates. Evidence duplicate detection, relationship integrity and reconciliation against sources. Define entity classes, stable identifiers, required attributes and relations.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `content-designer:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- User research and terminology findings

- Design flows and states
- Support contact themes

**Specification:** `kind/role/content-designer:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

## readability and comprehension test results

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: readability and comprehension test results.
- **Mandatory examples:** Link test cases and requirements to actual outcomes, timestamps and execution evidence. Explain defects, untested scope, achieved exit criteria and residual release risk. Identify build, requirements, environment, reporting period and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `content-designer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- User research and terminology findings
- Legal and regulatory wording constraints
- Design flows and states
- Support contact themes

**Specification:** `kind/role/content-designer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: readability and comprehension test results.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-report`](spec-type-test-report.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `test-results`.

Observed test results against a named baseline with passed, failed, blocked and unexecuted cases.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- expected/actual observations and execution references
- coverage denominators and residual defects

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
