## Supplier risk assessments and tiering

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Supplier risk assessments and tiering.
- **Mandatory examples:** Link assets, causes, events, consequences and inherent/residual ratings to evidence. Define scope, likelihood, impact scales and applicable risk appetite. Assign treatments, deadlines, risk owners and residual acceptance authority.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `third-party-risk-manager:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Supplier inventory and criticality
- Supplier assurance evidence
- Contract terms
- Concentration and substitutability analysis

**Specification:** `kind/role/third-party-risk-manager:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Supplier risk assessments and tiering.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/risk-assessment`](spec-type-risk-assessment.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `risk-assessment`.

Scenario-based risk assessment using explicit evaluation criteria and treatment accountability.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- likelihood/impact rationale and uncertainty
- current/residual exposure and treatment evidence

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## contractual control requirements

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: contractual control requirements.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `third-party-risk-manager:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Supplier inventory and criticality
- Supplier assurance evidence
- Contract terms
- Concentration and substitutability analysis

**Specification:** `kind/role/third-party-risk-manager:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: contractual control requirements.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `professional-document`.

Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

## ongoing monitoring and exit plans

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: ongoing monitoring and exit plans.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define sequenced increments, resources, milestones and measurable acceptance. Describe current and target outcomes, accountable owners and planning assumptions. Link dependencies, funding constraints, risks and decision dates to affected increments.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `third-party-risk-manager:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Supplier inventory and criticality
- Supplier assurance evidence
- Contract terms
- Concentration and substitutability analysis

**Specification:** `kind/role/third-party-risk-manager:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: ongoing monitoring and exit plans.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/roadmap`](spec-type-roadmap.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `outcome-roadmap`.

Sequenced outcomes/work packages with accountable owners, dependencies, dates and measurable milestones.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- current/target baseline and planning assumptions
- resource/funding constraints and decision triggers

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
