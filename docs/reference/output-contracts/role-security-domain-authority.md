## Domain security policy and standards

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Domain security policy and standards.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `security-domain-authority:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Domain model and trust design
- Domain business ownership
- Domain risk assessments
- Cross-domain requests

**Specification:** `kind/role/security-domain-authority:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Domain security policy and standards.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `professional-document`.

Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- attributable subject-specific findings and limitations
- reviewable sources and verifiable follow-up actions

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## domain risk acceptance decisions

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: domain risk acceptance decisions.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `security-domain-authority:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Domain model and trust design
- Domain business ownership
- Domain risk assessments
- Cross-domain requests

**Specification:** `kind/role/security-domain-authority:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: domain risk acceptance decisions.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

## domain conformance reporting

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: domain conformance reporting.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define tested obligations, assurance period, sample and exclusions. Link procedures and observed results to immutable evidence and located deviations. Limit the independent conclusion to tested scope, evidence strength and unresolved findings.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `security-domain-authority:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Domain model and trust design
- Domain business ownership
- Domain risk assessments
- Cross-domain requests

**Specification:** `kind/role/security-domain-authority:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: domain conformance reporting.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/assurance-report`](spec-type-assurance-report.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `assurance-assessment`.

Evidence-linked assessment with criteria, population/sample, observed findings and bounded conclusion.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- criterion-to-test-to-observation traceability
- independent reviewer and limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
