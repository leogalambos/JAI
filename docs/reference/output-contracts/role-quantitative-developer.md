## Model implementation code

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Model implementation code.
- **Mandatory examples:** Trace implemented behaviour and changed interfaces to requirements, design constraints and the exact reviewed source revision. Define deployment compatibility, telemetry, failure detection and rollback or forward recovery constraints. Identify reproducible automated checks, observed results, untested risks and independent review findings without inventing execution.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `quantitative-developer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Model specification
- Market and reference data
- Latency and throughput requirements
- Model risk requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/quantitative-developer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Model implementation code.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/software-change`](spec-family-software-change.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-source-change`.

Actual version-controlled implementation or analysis code, separate from its explanatory report.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- exact source and dependency revision
- observed checks and independent review

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## model change documentation for validation

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: model change documentation for validation.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `quantitative-developer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Model specification
- Market and reference data
- Latency and throughput requirements
- Model risk requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/quantitative-developer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: model change documentation for validation.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `professional-document`.

Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- attributable subject-specific findings and limitations
- reviewable sources and verifiable follow-up actions

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: model change documentation for validation.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218); [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Test Analyst; Internal IT Auditor), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218); [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218); [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218); [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'model change documentation for validation', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: State the exact subject, intended recipient/use, boundary, source versions and the concrete question the document answers. Provide subject-specific findings or instructions with supporting facts, assumptions, reasoning, limitations and traceable references; generic background alone is insufficient. State conclusions, decisions requested or actionable instructions, accountable recipients and completion/acceptance conditions; identify open issues explicitly. Existing source requirement: The model is validated against real observed behaviour or data, not only interviews. Required delivery form: Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218); [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/quantitative-developer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Every model implementation is reconciled against an independent reference implementation before use, and the reconciliation evidence is retained
