## Research plans and discussion guides

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Research plans and discussion guides.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define sequenced increments, resources, milestones and measurable acceptance. Describe current and target outcomes, accountable owners and planning assumptions. Link dependencies, funding constraints, risks and decision dates to affected increments.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ux-researcher:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Research questions
- Access to users
- Prior research
- Ethical and privacy constraints

**Specification:** `kind/role/ux-researcher:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Research plans and discussion guides.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/roadmap`](spec-type-roadmap.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `outcome-roadmap`.

Sequenced outcomes/work packages with accountable owners, dependencies, dates and measurable milestones.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- current/target baseline and planning assumptions
- resource/funding constraints and decision triggers

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## research findings and evidence repository

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: research findings and evidence repository.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ux-researcher:2`.

**Required inputs:**

- Research questions
- Access to users

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- actual source-attributed records
- uniqueness, completeness and relationship reconciliation

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## insight synthesis and recommendations

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: insight synthesis and recommendations.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ux-researcher:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Research questions
- Access to users
- Prior research
- Ethical and privacy constraints

**Specification:** `kind/role/ux-researcher:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: insight synthesis and recommendations.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/analysis-report`](spec-family-analysis-report.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned source/period/population and reproducible method
- observations, uncertainty, counterevidence and accountable follow-up

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
