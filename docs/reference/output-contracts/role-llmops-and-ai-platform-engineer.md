## Model serving and gateway configuration

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Model serving and gateway configuration.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify managed assets, tool/schema versions and authorised configuration scope. Provide typed desired settings, permitted ranges and secret-manager references. Evidence reproducibility, drift checks, deployment validation and rollback to a known baseline.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `llmops-and-ai-platform-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Use case requirements
- Safety and content policy
- Latency and cost targets
- Model provider capabilities

**Specification:** `kind/role/llmops-and-ai-platform-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Model serving and gateway configuration.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-configuration`.

Typed desired-state configuration with exact targets, versioned values and controlled secret references.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- reproduction/drift observations
- verification and recovery to a known baseline

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## evaluation harness and regression suites

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: evaluation harness and regression suites.
- **Mandatory examples:** Give reproducible invocation, assertions, expected outcomes and failure diagnostics; distinguish test definitions from evidence of executed runs. Define isolation, dependency handling, flakiness investigation, coverage limitations and maintenance ownership. Trace executable cases and reusable test abstractions to requirements, risk coverage, deterministic data and environment assumptions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `llmops-and-ai-platform-engineer:2`.

**Required inputs:**

- Use case requirements

## prompt and configuration version control

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: prompt and configuration version control.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify managed assets, tool/schema versions and authorised configuration scope. Provide typed desired settings, permitted ranges and secret-manager references. Evidence reproducibility, drift checks, deployment validation and rollback to a known baseline.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `llmops-and-ai-platform-engineer:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Use case requirements
- Safety and content policy
- Latency and cost targets
- Model provider capabilities

**Specification:** `kind/role/llmops-and-ai-platform-engineer:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: prompt and configuration version control.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-configuration`.

Typed desired-state configuration with exact targets, versioned values and controlled secret references.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- reproduction/drift observations
- verification and recovery to a known baseline

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## cost and token consumption reporting

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: cost and token consumption reporting.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
