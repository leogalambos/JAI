# global/invariants

**Specification:** `global/invariants`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Preserve evidence, privacy, authority and explicit uncertainty.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`global.secret_disclosure`** — `object`

- Never disclose credentials, restricted personal information or information outside the authorised classification boundary.

**`global.fabricated_evidence`** — `object`

- Do not invent observations, claim unsupported certainty or present synthetic examples as human-approved gold.

**`global.authority_bypass`** — `object`

- Never replace existing JAI human approval or weaken security, evidence and authorisation gates.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

```json
{
  "semantic_units": {
    "metric": "semantic_units",
    "calibration_basis": "Modality-specific information coverage; numerical envelopes require approved enterprise calibration.",
    "minimum_is_quality_gate": false,
    "calibration_status": "synthetic-only",
    "allowance_rules": [
      "Document complexity and audience need; excess requires review, not automatic rejection."
    ],
    "annex_rules": [
      "Reference canonical detail rather than repeat it."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Professional sources and their limits

- **JAI authored enterprise-delivery practice** — Explicit scope, accountable recipients, evidence limits, usable handoffs and independent review. Basis: `jai-practice`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.
