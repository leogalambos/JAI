## Analysis notebook or query set

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Analysis notebook or query set.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify the specific choice, accountable authority and decision deadline. Explain cost, benefit, dependencies, uncertainty and residual risks of the recommendation. Compare viable options including the do-nothing baseline against common criteria.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `data-analyst:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business question
- Source data and dictionaries
- Metric definitions
- Known data quality issues

**Specification:** `kind/role/data-analyst:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Analysis notebook or query set.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/decision-paper`](spec-type-decision-paper.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Professional sources and their limits

- **[W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary Version 3 (DCAT 3)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/)** — Dataset/catalogue identity, distributions, provenance, access and descriptive metadata. Basis: `informed-by`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.
- **[W3C Data Quality Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/)** — Quality dimensions, metrics, measurements and quality annotations; this source is a Working Group Note. Basis: `informed-by`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.

## data quality exceptions

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: data quality exceptions.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `data-analyst:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business question
- Source data and dictionaries
- Metric definitions
- Known data quality issues

**Specification:** `kind/role/data-analyst:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: data quality exceptions.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/data-analyst:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: data quality exceptions.

**`role/data-analyst:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Product Analyst; decision-makers), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.

**`role/data-analyst:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.

**`role/data-analyst:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.

**`role/data-analyst:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'data quality exceptions', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Reviewed by a competent second party; complete, dated and attributable. Required delivery form: Versioned artefact in the agreed system of record.

**`role/data-analyst:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: Every requirement is atomic, testable, prioritised and traced to a named source.
- G2: Conflicting stakeholder positions are recorded as open conflicts, never averaged into a vague compromise.
- G3: Assumptions and constraints are listed separately from requirements and each has an owner.
- G4: The primary deliverable ("Analysis notebook or query set") has been walked through with the people who will build, test and operate the result.
- G5: Every figure published states its source table, its filter logic, its as-at date and its known quality limitations

**`role/data-analyst:4.contract_input_1`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Business question" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/data-analyst:4.contract_input_2`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Source data and dictionaries" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/data-analyst:4.contract_input_3`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Metric definitions" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/data-analyst:4.contract_input_4`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Known data quality issues" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

### Conditionally required information

**`role/data-analyst:4.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify in-scope personal-data flows, minimisation, authorised handling and competent review evidence.

**`role/data-analyst:4.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.

### Optional information (MAY)

**`role/data-analyst:4.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`role/data-analyst:4.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`role/data-analyst:4.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.
