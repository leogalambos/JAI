## Instrumentation standards and libraries

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Instrumentation standards and libraries.
- **Mandatory examples:** Trace implemented behaviour and changed interfaces to requirements, design constraints and the exact reviewed source revision. Define deployment compatibility, telemetry, failure detection and rollback or forward recovery constraints. Identify reproducible automated checks, observed results, untested risks and independent review findings without inventing execution.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `observability-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Service level objectives
- Application instrumentation needs
- Incident review findings
- Telemetry cost position

**Specification:** `kind/role/observability-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Instrumentation standards and libraries.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/software-change`](spec-family-software-change.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/observability-engineer:1.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: Instrumentation standards and libraries.

- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/observability-engineer:1.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/observability-engineer:1.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Every alert has an owner, a documented action and a link to a runbook
- G9: alerts that nobody actions are deleted rather than muted
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/observability-engineer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: telemetry cost and retention policy.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Software Engineer; Incident Manager), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'telemetry cost and retention policy', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Every statement is testable and maps to at least one control. Required delivery form: Controlled document with owner, effective date and review date.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Every alert has an owner, a documented action and a link to a runbook
- G9: alerts that nobody actions are deleted rather than muted

**`role/observability-engineer:4.contract_input_1`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Service level objectives" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.contract_input_2`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Application instrumentation needs" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.contract_input_3`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Incident review findings" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.contract_input_4`** — `object`

- Analyse the specific input "Telemetry cost position" for this deliverable: identify its version, relevant entities/values, constraints, implications and unresolved evidence gaps.

### Conditionally required information

**`role/observability-engineer:4.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify in-scope personal-data flows, minimisation, authorised handling and competent review evidence.

**`role/observability-engineer:4.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.

### Optional information (MAY)

**`role/observability-engineer:4.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`role/observability-engineer:4.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`role/observability-engineer:4.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

```json
{
  "semantic_units": {
    "metric": "semantic_units",
    "calibration_basis": "Modality-specific information coverage; numerical envelopes require approved enterprise calibration.",
    "minimum_is_quality_gate": false,
    "calibration_status": "synthetic-only",
    "allowance_rules": [
      "Document complexity and audience need; excess requires review, not automatic rejection."
    ],
    "annex_rules": [
      "Reference canonical detail rather than repeat it."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Professional sources and their limits

- **JAI authored enterprise-delivery practice** — Explicit scope, accountable recipients, evidence limits, usable handoffs and independent review. Basis: `jai-practice`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.

### Role framework context

- **Observability Engineer:** OpenTelemetry; USE and RED methods; Google SRE alerting philosophy. Canonical role context; not proof that every listed framework applies to this output.
