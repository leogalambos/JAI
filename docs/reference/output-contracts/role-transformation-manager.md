## Change impact assessment

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Change impact assessment.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `transformation-manager:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Target operating model
- Affected process inventory
- Workforce capability baseline
- Go-live plan

**Specification:** `kind/role/transformation-manager:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Change impact assessment.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/analysis-report`](spec-family-analysis-report.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned source/period/population and reproducible method
- observations, uncertainty, counterevidence and accountable follow-up

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## adoption and readiness measures

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: adoption and readiness measures.
- **Mandatory examples:** Explain thresholds, uncertainty, missing data and actions supported by the view. Define metrics, units, denominators, targets, refresh cadence and accountable owners. Provide dated observations linked to versioned source queries and population scope.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `transformation-manager:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Target operating model
- Affected process inventory
- Workforce capability baseline
- Go-live plan

**Specification:** `kind/role/transformation-manager:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: adoption and readiness measures.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`type/dashboard`](spec-type-dashboard.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `measured-dashboard`.

Dashboard or scorecard with metric definitions, observations, source queries and interpretation.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- units, denominators and measurement windows
- dated values, thresholds and actionable exceptions

## new operating model definition

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: new operating model definition.
- **Mandatory examples:** List stable source-model element IDs, typed relations and labels represented in the view. Evidence endpoint validity, semantic compatibility, coverage and visual readability. Define the concern, viewpoint, system boundary, legend and notation.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `transformation-manager:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Target operating model
- Affected process inventory
- Workforce capability baseline
- Go-live plan

**Specification:** `kind/role/transformation-manager:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: new operating model definition.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/diagram`](spec-type-diagram.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `model-derived-view`.

Concern-specific diagram with declared notation, legend, typed relationships and source-element links.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- endpoint/meaning/coverage checks
- legibility and explicit projection limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
