# sabsa/risk-treatment-plan

**Specification:** `sabsa/risk-treatment-plan`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Risks/opportunities, objectives, exceptions and transition actions

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`kind/risk-assessment`](spec-kind-risk-assessment.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.business_traceability`** — `array`

- Trace selected security elements to business drivers, measurable attributes and source model IDs.

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.matrix_coverage`** — `array`

- Account for all 36 SABSA cells through selected source elements or explicit applicability reasons; never invent missing architecture facts.

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.sabsa_risk_treatments`** — `array`

- Link each risk/opportunity to business attributes, control objectives, treatment owner and due date.

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.sabsa_residual_acceptance`** — `array`

- Record residual exposure, exception scope/expiry and mandated risk acceptance authority.

### Conditionally required information

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify in-scope personal-data flows, minimisation, authorised handling and competent review evidence.

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.

### Optional information (MAY)

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`sabsa/risk-treatment-plan.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

### Professional sources and their limits

- **JAI authored enterprise-delivery practice** — Explicit scope, accountable recipients, evidence limits, usable handoffs and independent review. Basis: `jai-practice`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.
