## DNS zone and record management records

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: DNS zone and record management records.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Address plan
- Service naming requirements
- Security requirements including DNS filtering
- Change requests

**Specification:** `kind/role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: DNS zone and record management records.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: DNS zone and record management records.

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Network Engineer; Systems Administrator), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'DNS zone and record management records', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Reviewed by a competent second party; complete, dated and attributable. Required delivery form: Versioned artefact in the agreed system of record.

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:1.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: A recurring incident gets a root-cause analysis that compares against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors — duration, ordering, schedules, expiry — before a permanent fix is chosen (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G2: No change reaches production outside the agreed change path, including 'emergency' changes, which are logged retrospectively within the agreed window.
- G3: Evidence needed for root-cause analysis is preserved before destructive recovery actions.
- G4: Communication cadence is met for every major incident, with a named communications owner.
- G5: Every recurring incident has an open problem record; recurrence without a problem record is a process failure.
- G6: External domain and certificate expiry is monitored with alerting well before expiry
- G7: an expiry-driven outage is recorded as a preventable process failure

- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Address plan
- Service naming requirements
- Security requirements including DNS filtering
- Change requests

**Specification:** `kind/role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: resilience and failover configuration.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/configuration-baseline`](spec-type-configuration-baseline.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: resilience and failover configuration.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Network Engineer; Systems Administrator), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'resilience and failover configuration', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Reviewed by a competent second party; complete, dated and attributable. Required delivery form: Versioned artefact in the agreed system of record.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/dns-dhcp-and-ipam-specialist:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: A recurring incident gets a root-cause analysis that compares against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors — duration, ordering, schedules, expiry — before a permanent fix is chosen (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G2: No change reaches production outside the agreed change path, including 'emergency' changes, which are logged retrospectively within the agreed window.
- G3: Evidence needed for root-cause analysis is preserved before destructive recovery actions.
- G4: Communication cadence is met for every major incident, with a named communications owner.
- G5: Every recurring incident has an open problem record; recurrence without a problem record is a process failure.
- G6: External domain and certificate expiry is monitored with alerting well before expiry
- G7: an expiry-driven outage is recorded as a preventable process failure
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).
