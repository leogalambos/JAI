## Licence rule interpretation notes

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Licence rule interpretation notes.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `software-licence-compliance-specialist:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Entitlement documents
- Deployment and usage measurements
- Vendor licensing rules and changes
- Architecture changes affecting licensing

**Specification:** `kind/role/software-licence-compliance-specialist:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Licence rule interpretation notes.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `professional-document`.

Purpose-specific professional document with source analysis, reasoning, conclusions and recipient actions.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- attributable subject-specific findings and limitations
- reviewable sources and verifiable follow-up actions

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

For each criterion, identify procedure, sample, observed result, supporting material and located deviations; distinguish absent evidence from demonstrated failure. Bound the conclusion by coverage and limitations; list findings, severity rationale, management response, remediation owner and verification needed for closure. Existing source requirement: Chain of custody is unbroken and the set is reproducible from the record. Required delivery form: Evidence-linked assessment with criteria, population/sample, observed findings and bounded conclusion.

**`role/software-licence-compliance-specialist:3.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: Assessment criteria are fixed and documented before evidence collection begins.
- G2: Every finding is supported by retained, dated, attributable evidence.
- G3: The assessor is independent of the activity being assessed; any conflict is declared and documented.
- G4: Management responses record an owner, a date and an accepted residual risk for every finding.
- G5: Architecture changes with licensing impact (virtualisation, containerisation, cloud bursting) are assessed before implementation, because retrospective compliance is the most expensive kind

## licensing risk register

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: licensing risk register.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `software-licence-compliance-specialist:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Entitlement documents
- Deployment and usage measurements
- Vendor licensing rules and changes
- Architecture changes affecting licensing

**Specification:** `kind/role/software-licence-compliance-specialist:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: licensing risk register.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- actual source-attributed records
- uniqueness, completeness and relationship reconciliation

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
