## Control design documentation

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Control design documentation.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define measurable effectiveness tests, evidence collection and exception handling. Define preventive/detective/corrective actions, triggers, inputs and failure behaviour. Link control objectives to risks, business requirements and accountable owners.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `control-owner:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Control requirement and risk it addresses
- Operating procedures
- Test results
- Exceptions and incidents

**Specification:** `kind/role/control-owner:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Control design documentation.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/control-design`](spec-type-control-design.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `control-specification`.

Control specification with objectives, trigger, actor, actions, failure paths and effectiveness measures.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- risk/obligation traceability
- measurable operating effectiveness checks

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: control performance and exception reporting.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/assurance-report`](spec-type-assurance-report.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `assurance-assessment`.

Evidence-linked assessment with criteria, population/sample, observed findings and bounded conclusion.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- criterion-to-test-to-observation traceability
- independent reviewer and limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## remediation of control failures

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: remediation of control failures.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `control-owner:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Control requirement and risk it addresses
- Operating procedures
- Test results
- Exceptions and incidents

**Specification:** `kind/role/control-owner:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: remediation of control failures.

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**
