## Business attribute profile

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Business attribute profile.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `business-attribute-profiler:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business drivers and objectives
- Stakeholder expectations
- Regulatory constraints
- Existing performance data

**Specification:** `kind/role/business-attribute-profiler:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Business attribute profile.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- actual source-attributed records
- uniqueness, completeness and relationship reconciliation

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## traceability from drivers to attributes

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: traceability from drivers to attributes.
- **Mandatory examples:** Evidence uniqueness, referential integrity, completeness and lifecycle reconciliation checks. Provide actual uniquely identified records with source, owner, status and review date. Define required columns, datatypes, identifiers, allowed states and ownership.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `business-attribute-profiler:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business drivers and objectives
- Stakeholder expectations
- Regulatory constraints
- Existing performance data

**Specification:** `kind/role/business-attribute-profiler:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: traceability from drivers to attributes.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/register`](spec-type-register.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `governed-register`.

Purpose-specific structured records with stable IDs, schema, owner, status and lifecycle rules.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- actual source-attributed records
- uniqueness, completeness and relationship reconciliation

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
