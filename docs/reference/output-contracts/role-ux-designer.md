## Interaction designs and prototypes

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Interaction designs and prototypes.
- **Mandatory examples:** Identify decisions or downstream uses, accountable recipients and verifiable next actions. Provide attributable substantive findings, reasoning and limitations for the specific subject. Identify document purpose, audience, subject boundary and authoritative source versions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ux-designer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- User research findings
- Product requirements
- Technical constraints
- Design system components

**Specification:** `kind/role/ux-designer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Interaction designs and prototypes.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/document`](spec-type-document.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `interactive-design-prototype`.

Actual editable design/prototype assets or interaction-tool project with linked screens, transitions and loading, empty, error states; implementation code is required only when explicitly in scope.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- exact design revision, tool/version, access and export constraints
- state/flow coverage and observed evaluation findings or explicit not-tested status

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: design specification with all states.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/solution-design`](spec-type-solution-design.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `solution-design`.

Versioned solution design with component responsibilities, interfaces and measurable quality responses.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- requirements-to-design traceability
- independent design review

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## usability test findings

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: usability test findings.
- **Mandatory examples:** Link test cases and requirements to actual outcomes, timestamps and execution evidence. Explain defects, untested scope, achieved exit criteria and residual release risk. Identify build, requirements, environment, reporting period and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `ux-designer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- User research findings
- Product requirements
- Technical constraints
- Design system components

**Specification:** `kind/role/ux-designer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: usability test findings.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-report`](spec-type-test-report.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `test-results`.

Observed test results against a named baseline with passed, failed, blocked and unexecuted cases.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- expected/actual observations and execution references
- coverage denominators and residual defects

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
