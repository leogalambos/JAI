## Mobile test plan aligned to OWASP MASTG

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Mobile test plan aligned to OWASP MASTG.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define test levels, techniques, environments, representative data and responsibilities. Define traceable entry/exit criteria, coverage measurement and defect disposition rules. Define risk-based test objectives, quality targets, scope and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `penetration-tester-mobile:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Signed authorisation and scope
- Application builds for each platform
- Test accounts and backend scope
- Device and OS matrix

**Specification:** `kind/role/penetration-tester-mobile:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Mobile test plan aligned to OWASP MASTG.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-strategy`](spec-type-test-strategy.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

**`role/penetration-tester-mobile:4.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Optional information (MAY)

**`role/penetration-tester-mobile:4.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`role/penetration-tester-mobile:4.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`role/penetration-tester-mobile:4.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

```json
{
  "semantic_units": {
    "metric": "semantic_units",
    "calibration_basis": "Modality-specific information coverage; numerical envelopes require approved enterprise calibration.",
    "minimum_is_quality_gate": false,
    "calibration_status": "synthetic-only",
    "allowance_rules": [
      "Document complexity and audience need; excess requires review, not automatic rejection."
    ],
    "annex_rules": [

### Professional sources and their limits

- **[NIST SP 800-53A Revision 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5)** — Assessment objectives, methods, evidence, findings and bounded assessment conclusions. Basis: `informed-by`. JAI-authored interpretation of the named subject. No clause-level conformance, certification or automatic applicability is asserted.

### Role framework context

- **Penetration Tester (Mobile):** OWASP MASTG and MASVS; PTES; platform security documentation. Canonical role context; not proof that every listed framework applies to this output.
