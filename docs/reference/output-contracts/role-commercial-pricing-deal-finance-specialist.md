## Deal financial and cash-flow model

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Deal financial and cash-flow model
- **Mandatory examples:** Record source versions, extraction time, transformations, lawful access and retention. Evidence completeness, uniqueness, consistency, drift and permitted-use limitations. Define fields, datatypes, units, keys, null handling and allowed values.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Scoped cost and effort estimate with uncertainty and resource rates
- Margin, return, discount, contingency and credit policy
- Payment, acceptance, liability, indexation, SLA, currency and exit terms
- Billing milestones, delivery/service schedule and resource pyramid

**Specification:** `kind/role/commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Deal financial and cash-flow model

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/dataset`](spec-type-dataset.md)
- [`domain/data`](spec-domain-data.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-deal-financial-model`.

Actual versioned financial/cash-flow model with formulas, dated rate/cost assumptions and scenario results; a funding approval paper is not the model.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- reconciled revenue/cost/cash-flow inputs and calculation lineage
- margin, timing and sensitivity results with explicit uncertainty

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## Deal baseline and variance review

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Deal baseline and variance review
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Scoped cost and effort estimate with uncertainty and resource rates
- Margin, return, discount, contingency and credit policy
- Payment, acceptance, liability, indexation, SLA, currency and exit terms
- Billing milestones, delivery/service schedule and resource pyramid

**Specification:** `kind/role/commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Deal baseline and variance review

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/analysis-report`](spec-family-analysis-report.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned source/period/population and reproducible method
- observations, uncertainty, counterevidence and accountable follow-up

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

**`role/commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:3.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'Deal baseline and variance review', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request.

**`role/commercial-pricing-deal-finance-specialist:3.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.

- G3: Downside cases cover delivery and run/exit obligations, including schedule, volume and payment uncertainty.
- G4: No recommendation is treated as a signed price, discount approval, credit decision or legal/accounting opinion.
- G5: Critical business-to-economics-to-evidence links and client/internal commitment consistency are complete; unresolved links remain visible and decision-limiting.
- G6: Lifecycle effort and cost, including recurring service and exit where relevant, are classified without double-counting; missing evidence is never silently zero.
- G7: Author, independent reviewer and human approval/risk-acceptance boundaries are explicit; superseded versions and review/reopen triggers are retained.
