## Service level agreements and operational level agreements

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Service level agreements and operational level agreements.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define measurable availability, support, capacity and recovery targets. Describe support responsibilities, suppliers, monitoring, continuity and lifecycle costs. Identify customers, service owner, outcomes, boundaries and demand assumptions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `service-level-manager:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business requirements and tolerance
- Measured performance
- Supplier contract terms
- Improvement plans

**Specification:** `kind/role/service-level-manager:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Service level agreements and operational level agreements.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/service-design`](spec-type-service-design.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `service-definition`.

Service definition with consumers, outcomes, responsibilities and measurable service commitments.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- indicator/target/window definitions
- support, dependency and recovery arrangements

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

```json
{
  "semantic_units": {
    "metric": "semantic_units",
    "calibration_basis": "Modality-specific information coverage; numerical envelopes require approved enterprise calibration.",
    "minimum_is_quality_gate": false,
    "calibration_status": "synthetic-only",
    "allowance_rules": [
      "Document complexity and audience need; excess requires review, not automatic rejection."
    ],
    "annex_rules": [
      "Reference canonical detail rather than repeat it."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Professional sources and their limits

  **Practical method:** Distinguish service restoration, problem resolution, authorised change and receiving service acceptance with measured outcomes.
  **Selection:** Relevant candidates only; this is not a mandatory framework list.
  **Applicability assessment:** `global.framework_applicability`.

## service review packs

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: service review packs.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.

## supplier service level alignment

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: supplier service level alignment.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define measurable availability, support, capacity and recovery targets. Describe support responsibilities, suppliers, monitoring, continuity and lifecycle costs. Identify customers, service owner, outcomes, boundaries and demand assumptions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `service-level-manager:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Business requirements and tolerance
- Measured performance
- Supplier contract terms
- Improvement plans

**Specification:** `kind/role/service-level-manager:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: supplier service level alignment.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/service-design`](spec-type-service-design.md)
- [`domain/operations`](spec-domain-operations.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `service-definition`.

Service definition with consumers, outcomes, responsibilities and measurable service commitments.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- indicator/target/window definitions
- support, dependency and recovery arrangements

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
