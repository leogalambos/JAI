# type/migration-plan

**Specification:** `type/migration-plan`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Common typed foundation for migration-plan; no substitute for a substantive document kind.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`type/migration-plan.identity`** — `object`

- Identify stable artifact ID, owner, source version and intended usage.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`type/migration-plan.migration_inventory`** — `array`

- Identify source/target assets, data owners, versions and dependencies.
- Inventory source/target versions, data classes, owners, interfaces, dependencies and mapping or transformation rules.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`type/migration-plan.migration_waves`** — `array`

- Assign sequencing, capacity, reconciliation checks and acceptance criteria to each wave.
- For each wave, identify entry criteria, ordered activities, resource/window assumptions, reconciliation measures and receiving acceptance.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`type/migration-plan.migration_recovery`** — `object`

- Define integrity checks, fallback decision time, rollback and business continuity.
- State integrity checks, recovery points, fallback decision authority, latest safe reversal point and continuity arrangements for an unsuccessful wave.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Conditionally required information

**`type/migration-plan.privacy_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "processes_personal_data", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify in-scope personal-data flows, minimisation, authorised handling and competent review evidence.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`type/migration-plan.regulatory_analysis`** — `object`

Applies when: `{"field": "regulatory_requirement", "op": "eq", "value": true}`. If the needed context is unknown, resolve it before claiming completeness.

- Identify applicable obligation IDs, interpretation authority, compliance evidence and unresolved gaps.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Optional information (MAY)

**`type/migration-plan.supporting_annex`** — `object`

- Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-128); [source](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-34r1) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

### Prohibited content (MUST NOT)

**`type/migration-plan.unsupported_material_claim`** — `object`

- Do not assert material conclusions without dated evidence or an explicitly labelled assumption.

### Content to omit unless justified

**`type/migration-plan.irrelevant_detail`** — `object`

- Remove material unrelated to the stated purpose, required input analysis or receiving-role action.

### Proportionate scope

Inherited size guidance is reproduced below. It is not evidence of substantive completeness; verbosity is not a quality measure.

```json
{
  "semantic_units": {
    "metric": "semantic_units",
    "calibration_basis": "Modality-specific information coverage; numerical envelopes require approved enterprise calibration.",
    "minimum_is_quality_gate": false,
    "calibration_status": "synthetic-only",
    "allowance_rules": [
      "Document complexity and audience need; excess requires review, not automatic rejection."
    ],
    "annex_rules": [
      "Reference canonical detail rather than repeat it."
    ]
  }
}
```
