## Real-time design with timing budgets

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Real-time design with timing budgets.
- **Mandatory examples:** Describe bounded component responsibilities and deployment topology. Map measurable quality requirements to design verification and acceptance. Define versioned interface inputs, outputs, trust boundaries and failure handling.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `real-time-systems-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Timing and deadline requirements
- Hardware platform characteristics
- Failure mode analysis
- Certification requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/real-time-systems-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Real-time design with timing budgets.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/solution-design`](spec-type-solution-design.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## determinism test results

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: determinism test results.
- **Mandatory examples:** Link test cases and requirements to actual outcomes, timestamps and execution evidence. Explain defects, untested scope, achieved exit criteria and residual release risk. Identify build, requirements, environment, reporting period and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `real-time-systems-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Timing and deadline requirements
- Hardware platform characteristics
- Failure mode analysis
- Certification requirements

**Specification:** `kind/role/real-time-systems-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: determinism test results.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-report`](spec-type-test-report.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

### Required information (MUST)

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.delivery_scope`** — `object`

- Identify the subject entities, boundaries, outcomes and versioned sources for: Produce and govern the role deliverable: determinism test results.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.receiving_acceptance`** — `array`

- For each receiving role (Test Analyst; Embedded Firmware Engineer), identify the concrete downstream use, requested action, acceptance measure and accountable recipient.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.contract_relations`** — `array`

- Identify actual entity IDs and relationship instances for: owner_role -> receiving_roles; material claims -> evidence; decision -> approver where approval is required.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.decision_purpose_correction`** — `object`

- Identify the specific downstream operational action or choice, its accountable recipient and competent authority; confirm or correct the source-derived proposed action without inventing approval.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.delivery_verification`** — `array`

- For the specific output 'determinism test results', provide verifiable evidence satisfying: Identifies assessed scope, method, environment or population, expected and observed outcomes, located findings, untested conditions and residual limitations. Required delivery form: Versioned assessment results with traceable evidence.
- **Professional basis:** [source](https://www.iso.org/standard/79429.html) (informed-by; not a verbatim standard requirement).

**`role/real-time-systems-engineer:4.role_gate_observations`** — `array`

- Evaluate every applicable existing role gate using actual evidence and identified residual gaps; do not infer PASS from headings or DCS advisory status.
- G1: No change merges without passing automated tests and peer review by someone who did not write it.
- G2: A defect is fixed only after its root cause is established by comparing against the last known good state, a working analogue and timing factors, and a regression test reproduces it first (it-role-library/standards/defect-analysis.md).
- G3: Every public behaviour added or changed has unit tests covering normal, boundary and failure cases; every boundary to an external system has an integration test against the real dependency; the full suite was run after the last change and passed (it-role-library/standards/testing.md).
- G4: Secrets, credentials and personal data never appear in source, logs or fixtures.
- G5: Every public element of the change carries a doc comment stating its contract — parameters, result, exceptions — and no comment narrates what the code does (it-role-library/standards/code-documentation.md).
- G6: The change ships with the telemetry needed to tell whether it is working in production.
- G7: A rollback or forward-fix path is defined and has been tried at least once for high-risk changes.
- G8: Worst-case timing is demonstrated by measurement and analysis, never inferred from average-case behaviour
