## Cloud health and compliance reporting

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Cloud health and compliance reporting.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define tested obligations, assurance period, sample and exclusions. Link procedures and observed results to immutable evidence and located deviations. Limit the independent conclusion to tested scope, evidence strength and unresolved findings.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `cloud-operations-engineer:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Monitoring and alerting
- Policy and guardrail definitions
- Cost and usage data
- Change schedule

**Specification:** `kind/role/cloud-operations-engineer:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Cloud health and compliance reporting.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/assurance-report`](spec-type-assurance-report.md)
- [`domain/security`](spec-domain-security.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `assurance-assessment`.

Evidence-linked assessment with criteria, population/sample, observed findings and bounded conclusion.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- criterion-to-test-to-observation traceability
- independent reviewer and limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

Bound the conclusion by coverage and limitations; list findings, severity rationale, management response, remediation owner and verification needed for closure.

- G3: Evidence needed for root-cause analysis is preserved before destructive recovery actions.
- G4: Communication cadence is met for every major incident, with a named communications owner.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `cloud-operations-engineer:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Monitoring and alerting
- Policy and guardrail definitions
- Cost and usage data
- Change schedule

**Specification:** `kind/role/cloud-operations-engineer:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: configuration drift remediation.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/deployment-automation`](spec-family-deployment-automation.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `drift-remediation-change-and-execution-record`.

Actual versioned remediation configuration/script or controlled change, linked to the observed drift and execution outcome.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- desired/observed baseline, exact authorised change and target scope
- actual apply/verification/rollback outcomes or explicit not-executed status

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## operational cost anomalies

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: operational cost anomalies.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `cloud-operations-engineer:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Monitoring and alerting
- Policy and guardrail definitions
- Cost and usage data
- Change schedule

**Specification:** `kind/role/cloud-operations-engineer:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: operational cost anomalies.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned source/period/population and reproducible method

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.
