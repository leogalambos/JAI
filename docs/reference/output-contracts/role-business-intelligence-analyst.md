## Semantic model and metric definitions

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Semantic model and metric definitions.
- **Mandatory examples:** List stable source-model element IDs, typed relations and labels represented in the view. Evidence endpoint validity, semantic compatibility, coverage and visual readability. Define the concern, viewpoint, system boundary, legend and notation.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `business-intelligence-analyst:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Metric definitions and owners
- Modelled data
- Consumer requirements
- Access and sensitivity rules

**Specification:** `kind/role/business-intelligence-analyst:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Semantic model and metric definitions.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/diagram`](spec-type-diagram.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `model-derived-view`.

Concern-specific diagram with declared notation, legend, typed relationships and source-element links.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- endpoint/meaning/coverage checks
- legibility and explicit projection limitations

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## production dashboards

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: production dashboards.
- **Mandatory examples:** Explain thresholds, uncertainty, missing data and actions supported by the view. Define metrics, units, denominators, targets, refresh cadence and accountable owners. Provide dated observations linked to versioned source queries and population scope.

## data lineage documentation

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: data lineage documentation.
- **Mandatory examples:** Provide stable identified entities and typed relationships with ownership and provenance. Define entity/relation types, constraints, model boundary and source baseline. Evidence referential integrity, constraint checks, cross-view consistency and known gaps.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `business-intelligence-analyst:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Metric definitions and owners
- Modelled data
- Consumer requirements
- Access and sensitivity rules

**Specification:** `kind/role/business-intelligence-analyst:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: data lineage documentation.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/model`](spec-type-model.md)
- [`domain/architecture`](spec-domain-architecture.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `typed-semantic-model`.

Versioned typed model with stable entities, relations, constraints, provenance and selected views.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- metamodel/reference/cross-view checks
- source baseline and unresolved semantic gaps

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.
