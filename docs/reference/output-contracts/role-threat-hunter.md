## Hunt hypotheses and methodology

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: Hunt hypotheses and methodology.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define test levels, techniques, environments, representative data and responsibilities. Define traceable entry/exit criteria, coverage measurement and defect disposition rules. Define risk-based test objectives, quality targets, scope and exclusions.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `threat-hunter:1`.

**Required inputs:**

- Threat intelligence and adversary tradecraft
- Full telemetry access
- Environment and crown-jewel map
- Previous hunt results

**Specification:** `kind/role/threat-hunter:1`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: Hunt hypotheses and methodology.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`type/test-strategy`](spec-type-test-strategy.md)
- [`domain/testing`](spec-domain-testing.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `test-specification`.

Risk-based test specification with cases/techniques, expected outcomes, environments and entry/exit criteria.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- requirement/risk-to-case coverage
- data/sample rationale and untested risks

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## hunt findings and negative results

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: hunt findings and negative results.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `threat-hunter:2`.

**Required inputs:**

Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- **Mandatory examples:** Trace implemented behaviour and changed interfaces to requirements, design constraints and the exact reviewed source revision. Define deployment compatibility, telemetry, failure detection and rollback or forward recovery constraints. Identify reproducible automated checks, observed results, untested risks and independent review findings without inventing execution.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `threat-hunter:3`.

**Required inputs:**

- Threat intelligence and adversary tradecraft
- Full telemetry access
- Environment and crown-jewel map
- Previous hunt results

**Specification:** `kind/role/threat-hunter:3`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: new detection candidates.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

- [`global/invariants`](spec-global-invariants.md)
- [`family/software-change`](spec-family-software-change.md)
- [`domain/delivery`](spec-domain-delivery.md)

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `versioned-source-change`.

Actual version-controlled implementation or analysis code, separate from its explanatory report.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- exact source and dependency revision
- observed checks and independent review

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.

**Evidence policy for the following units:** versioned source reference or explicitly labelled assumption; retain pending status and identify owner; never fabricate.

## visibility gap findings

**At a glance**

- **Purpose:** Produce and govern the role deliverable: visibility gap findings.
- **Mandatory examples:** Define the actual analytical question, reporting period, population, source versions, method, measurement/reconciliation rules and exclusions. Explain what the evidence supports, alternative explanations, limits, impacts and accountable follow-up actions. A factual or status report does not require a fabricated option appraisal or approval request. Separate observed facts from hypotheses and assumptions; trace each material finding to reproducible evidence, calculations, chronology or source records with uncertainty and counterevidence.
- **Conditions to resolve:** personal data are processed; an applicable regulatory requirement exists. Unknown applicability remains unresolved.
- **Optional example:** Include versioned calculations, logs or technical detail only when linked to a specific required claim.
- **Review:** assess substantive content, evidence and gaps against the full selected contract; acceptance and release remain separate.

This orientation gives selected examples. The complete local and linked foundation requirements, prohibitions and evidence duties below remain applicable.

**Contract ID:** `threat-hunter:4`.

**Required inputs:**

- Threat intelligence and adversary tradecraft
- Full telemetry access
- Environment and crown-jewel map
- Previous hunt results

**Specification:** `kind/role/threat-hunter:4`; **content version:** `1.2.0`.

Produce and govern the role deliverable: visibility gap findings.

**Status:** proposed/advisory; publication of this contract does not approve it, certify a delivered output or grant acceptance/release. MUST describes the stated JAI content obligation, not a claim that an external standard mandates it.

**Also applicable:** all requirements in these linked foundations and overlays form part of this contract, subject to their explicit conditions:

Conditions below are not evaluated for a hypothetical engagement. Unknown applicability stays unresolved; it does not mean that the requirement may be omitted. Required information can be carried in prose, structured records or referenced material; matching a heading alone does not demonstrate quality.

### Primary work product and evidence

**Primary work product:** `evidence-based-analysis-report`.

Source-linked analytical, operational or investigative report with an explicit question, method, observed findings and bounded conclusions; no fabricated decision request.

**Evidence accompanying the work product:**

- versioned source/period/population and reproducible method
- observations, uncertainty, counterevidence and accountable follow-up

The historical artifact-type field is retained for compatibility; it does not require replacing this work product with a report or an EA diagram. Content guidance only; existing execution and human authority boundaries remain.
