# CI/CD pipeline assurance and release controls report — Order Event Integration

> **SYNTHETIC EXPERT REFERENCE / NOT AN APPROVED PROJECT RECORD.** All organisations, measurements, contracts, test results, approvals and evidence IDs are invented. Narrative is illustrative, not proof of implementation or statutory compliance. Do not copy synthetic values into a real deliverable as verified facts.

**Entity of interest:** cross-channel order ingestion and ERP fulfilment synchronisation. **Context:** Meridian Retail Group. **Complexity:** medium. **Status:** proposed phased delivery; no live ERP, market or regulatory evidence. **Decision authority:** Digital Commerce Sponsor, subject to separate competent security, finance and operational authority.

**Evidence rule:** distinguish proposed design, expected test, observed result and human approval. In this document observed execution = none; every run-specific status remains `NOT_EXECUTED` or `OPEN`.

<a id="dcs-proposed-cicd-pipeline-assurance.assurance_scope"></a>
## 1. Assurance scope

Assessment boundary includes repository `retail-order-integration`, privileged build workflow, provenance generation, registry, promotion and deployed digest for **cross-channel order ingestion and ERP fulfilment synchronisation**. Evaluate who can change a workflow and who may publish artifacts, not only whether the CI YAML parses. Trace source commit → run identity → produced digest → signature/attestation → release decision. A release tag is not proof of the build environment or artifact identity. The assessor is independent from pipeline maintainers.

<a id="dcs-proposed-cicd-pipeline-assurance.runner_trust"></a>
## 2. Runner trust

Runner trust controls: ephemeral isolation or demonstrably controlled cleanup, locked image origin, separation of untrusted PR execution, restricted egress when feasible, cache integrity, workload credentials scoped by audience/environment and managed secrets. Attack scenario: **country-routing error or privileged replay of events** coupled with compromised CI credential or a malicious dependency. Verify whether changes to branch protection and workflow policy require an independent decision. Any unknown run privilege remains an open assessment item.

## 3. Execution results

Assessment procedures inspect branch policy, run identity, toolchain pinning, dependency resolution, SAST/SCA logs, test execution, negative authorization checks and promotion approvals. Construct synthetic observations: source was tagged but no attestation available (NOT TESTED); build digest recorded but deployment mismatch proof absent (OPEN); simulated unprivileged PR attempted publication (EXPECTED DENY, NOT EXECUTED). Negative tests must not interact with production services or live credentials. Evidence IDs exist only for the example.

### Worked design matrix (synthetic)

| Assurance target | Test | Expected outcome | Evidence state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner permissions | Untrusted PR cannot publish | DENY | NOT EXECUTED |
| Attested build | Subject digest equals published digest | MATCH | NOT EXECUTED |
| Dependency source | Lockfile/materials consistent | VERIFIED OR BLOCKED | NOT EXECUTED |
| Deployment | Deployed digest equals reviewed subject | MATCH | NOT EXECUTED |

The matrix is a proposed verification instrument for **cross-channel order ingestion and ERP fulfilment synchronisation**. Its displayed rows are not actual enterprise observations. Evidence must be source-bound and independently interpreted before a finding or green status can support a project decision.

## 4. Provenance checks

Validate provenance predicate, builder identity, source/materials, artifact digest and signature/attestation verifier policy before production promotion. SLSA v1.2 is a framework for assurance guarantees; select an appropriate track/level only after evaluating requirements. A signed SBOM alone does not prove the build wasn't tampered with. The verified subject digest must be exactly the deployed subject, otherwise the attestation may refer to a different binary.

<a id="dcs-proposed-cicd-pipeline-assurance.exceptions_and_risks"></a>
## 5. Exceptions and risks

Unresolved evidence gaps: missing runner isolation test, absent retention-independent provenance store and unknown separation of signing from PR jobs. Risk owner Head of Digital Risk; proposed response is to block privileged publish until isolation and identity claims are verified. Findings require reproduction artifacts and business impact, not generic 'enable more scanning' advice. An exception can reduce a chosen policy gate only under existing organization authority and cannot fake test execution.

### Dependency and challenge analysis

For MRG-OEI, a release or transformation claim is invalid if **country data-handling decisions, broker retention, ERP freeze windows and vendor SLAs** remains unresolved. Check the counterfactual: what would break if the preferred technology were removed while user behavior and business service demand stayed constant? An independent reviewer should challenge the alleged root cause, hidden vendor commitments, failures spanning commerce cloud → broker → region-scoped ERP service, and who accepts an unsuccessful delivery when the sponsor and implementer disagree.

<a id="dcs-proposed-cicd-pipeline-assurance.release_attestation"></a>
## 6. Release attestation

**Disposition: NOT QUALIFIED** for the example because no real runner, build or signature verification was observed. Release evidence must name test suite, executed gate statuses, exceptions, final digest and competent approver. No signed record may be inferred from the synthetic example. Any missing required renderer or verifier must remain NOT EXECUTED and follow the existing release policy.

## Example decision register

| Decision | Alternatives / objections | Evidence needed | Owner and status |
|---|---|---|---|
| DR-01 — approve scoped approach | transactional outbox plus managed broker with a quarantine stream and idempotent consumers vs controlled baseline | Business invariant and dependency mapping | Digital Commerce Sponsor — OPEN |
| DR-02 — permit protected integration | Deny or quarantine unknown actor/entity vs permissive routing | Independent negative authorization and reconciliation | Head of Digital Risk — OPEN |
| DR-03 — accept operations handover | Reversible pilot vs direct cutover | 2 hours/15 minutes timed recovery, staffed on-call | Service Operations Manager — OPEN |

All decision IDs above are local worked-example identifiers; they are not proof that any person approved or that underlying evidence exists.

## Evidence register, validation and handoff

| Example evidence ID | Required underlying record | Status |
|---|---|---|
| MRG-OEI-E-SCOPE | Verifiable operating baseline, applicable entity/data obligations | PROPOSED / NOT OBSERVED |
| MRG-OEI-E-DESIGN | Versioned architecture/contract and independent review | PROPOSED |
| MRG-OEI-E-TEST | Executed test inputs, output, toolchain and build digest | NOT EXECUTED |
| MRG-OEI-E-OPS | Receiving service acceptance and live owner | PENDING |

**Minimum acceptance conditions:** authoritative requirement `MRG-OEI-REQ-01` traced to business owner; exact build `MRG-OEI-BUILD-01` and change `MRG-OEI-CHG-01` evidenced by immutable identifiers; critical controls evaluated on the intended trust boundary; explicit mitigation and verification of **duplicate or out-of-order messages create an incorrect fulfilment state**; completed handoff acknowledged by Service Operations Manager. An unsupported assumption remains OPEN and may justify deferral.

**Handoff graph:** MRG-OEI-REQ → MRG-OEI-ARCH → MRG-OEI-SEC → MRG-OEI-BUILD → MRG-OEI-TEST → MRG-OEI-OPS. These IDs are illustrative and must not be mistaken for existing documents.

**Methodological reference:** SLSA v1.2 Build Track and source/provenance assurance concepts. These frameworks inform professional coverage and challenge questions; this reference does not assert compliance or quote normative control clauses.

**Professional review disposition:** OPEN. No actual implementation, live provider validation, signed security assessment, executive approval or legal determination occurred.

## Evidence-led expert review supplement (v2.3.0)

> **Editorial status:** reviewer-designed example content for the fictional `MRG-OEI` context. No underlying customer system, security test, supplier quote or sign-off was inspected. This section is an illustrative professional decision aid, not completed assurance.

### Context-specific decision and evidence matrix

| Evaluation object | Explicit verification question | Evidence to request | Required disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runner isolation and protected branch policy | Is this statement supported for `MRG-OEI` by a source-controlled input with an identified owner? | Source record, scope identifier, timestamp and version | OPEN until attributable evidence exists |
| Replayable build and attestation proof | Is the claim testable against a falsifiable success or failure criterion? | Expected/observed values and independent review result | NOT_EXECUTED if no actual test or review |
| Missing control classified NOT_EXECUTED | Does the proposed conclusion change a decision, cost, permission or release condition? | Approval or refusal recorded in the existing JAI authority mechanism | PENDING, never inferred approval |

### Technical expert challenge — control evidence and negative test

For an asserted control, record control objective, relevant asset or trust boundary, planned negative scenario, required technical trace and control owner; absent observed evidence is NOT_EXECUTED. For **cicd-pipeline-assurance**, the reviewer should actively challenge **runner isolation and protected branch policy** and **replayable build and attestation proof**. A plausible narrative without attributable source material remains a proposed hypothesis.

### Management challenge — assurance scope

State assessment population, methodology and exposure window. Separate design review from observed operating effectiveness and from risk acceptance. The accountable party for this illustrative acceptance is **Independent Security Reviewer / Risk Owner**, not an unspecified project team. Required management decision: **DEFER external commitment or release when a material evidence gap remains**. Create a tracked action with named owner, due date, acceptance predicate and escalation path; none is asserted as completed here.

### Presentation and reader decision check

**Decision headline:** evidence is insufficient for an unconditional approval; the current proposal is fit for discussion and refinement only. **What matters now:** runner isolation and protected branch policy, replayable build and attestation proof, and missing control classified not_executed. **Next step:** obtain original evidence, reconcile contradictory figures and issue an updated, independently reviewed version. Use descriptive heading hierarchy, non-colour-only statuses, concise table labels, explicit units and a separate annex for technical detail. Do not bury exceptions below a visually positive summary.

### Decision-oriented quality acceptance

| Test | Expected finding for this fictional example | Decision implication |
|---|---|---|
| Source fidelity | Unverified example facts are marked synthetic or assumed | No production factual claim |
| Cross-artifact consistency | IDs, scope, prices, controls and status must reconcile with linked artifacts | Any substantive mismatch requires correction |
| Independent review | No real reviewer evidence is provided | Human-approved status remains **false** |
| Publication quality | Headings, tables, links and any figures must render without truncation; validate when a renderer is present | Missing renderer = NOT_EXECUTED, not PASS |
